I&amp;rsquo;ve often experienced that when writing for this very blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a topic like programming or cooking that I want to share a thought about, and get stuck&amp;hellip; starting.

Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re simply one-off papers that only need to be a page or two (like for my Ethics class), in which case it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter what I write the papers in or whether I back them up in any meaningful capacity. In theory, if the worst happened and I lost the file, I could rewrite it in a couple of hours and it wouldnâ€™t be the end of the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
