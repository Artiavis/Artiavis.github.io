fascinating field known as “big data”. “Big data” is an umbrella term to describe data whose qualities are so atypical
that classical data analysis techniques fail to even begin to tackle understanding them. The data can be in any
conceivable format and in any field of study. For instance, in news analysis, “How are news articles relevantly accessed
when more arrive in a single day than a person can read in a lifetime?” Or for internet security, “Can login attempt
information from internet users across the world predict when a potential login request is coming from a spam-bot?”
Perhaps most interestingly, “Can anonymous medical patient data be leveraged to provide advanced diagnostic
capabilities?” (These are all real examples of active research being conducted by members of the the panel I attended.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
