I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to already have had a job lined up for after graduation for a while, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm. Most people are only beginning to look for jobs and internships now. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be an expert at searching for jobs (far from it), I have been out there since my freshman year, so I do have a couple of tips which will hopefully be helpful.</description></item><item><title>A Slight Change in Scheduleâ€¦</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2014/02/04/a-slight-change-in-schedule/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2014/02/04/a-slight-change-in-schedule/</guid><description>Three months ago, I posted my tentative schedule for this semester, my final one in undergrad.

I don&amp;rsquo;t think the significance of this coming semester being my final one has quite sunk in yet. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s simply due to me already being in the middle of the semester now, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet begun panicking or experiencing &amp;lsquo;senioritis&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure those will both come in due time, but in the meantime, I had to figure out which classes to take to round up my college education.</description></item></channel></rss>
