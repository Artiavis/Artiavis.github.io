graduation (or just the summer if they&amp;rsquo;re continuing at University). I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to already have had a job
lined up for after graduation for a while, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm. Most people are only beginning to look for jobs and
internships now. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be an expert at searching for jobs (far from it), I have been out there since
my freshman year, so I do have a couple of tips which will hopefully be helpful. Although my particular field,
Technology, is very large and highly in-demand, most work-hunting advice applies across the board.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Slight Change in Scheduleâ€¦</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2014/02/04/a-slight-change-in-schedule/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2014/02/04/a-slight-change-in-schedule/</guid><description>&lt;p>Three months ago, &lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/10/28/classes-for-final-semester/">I posted my tentative schedule&lt;/a> for this semester, my final one in
undergrad. At the time, I was very optimistic about taking &lt;em>Systems Programming&lt;/em> because I had been recommended the
professor, Brian Russell, by my roommate. In the end, I switched it out for a seminar in &lt;em>Gender and Sexuality in Judaism&lt;/em>. Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overlap-between-systems-and-network">Overlap Between &lt;em>Systems&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Network&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Originally, I signed up for both &lt;em>Systems Programming&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Network-centric Programming&lt;/em>,
both of which are low-level programming courses in the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language&lt;/a>.
Although they both involve programming at a similar conceptual level, and involve writing programs of similar size and complexity,
I decided to go with &lt;em>Network-centric&lt;/em> instead of &lt;em>Systems&lt;/em> because I feel it covers more advanced materials in
addition to the basics already covered by &lt;em>Systems&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Classes for Final Semester</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/10/28/classes-for-final-semester/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/10/28/classes-for-final-semester/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently finished signing up for (hopefully) my final semester of
(undergraduate) classes at University. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the significance of this
coming semester being my final one has quite sunk in yet. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s simply due
to me already being in the middle of the semester now, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet begun
panicking or experiencing &amp;lsquo;senioritis&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure those will both come in due
time, but in the meantime, I had to figure out which classes to take to round up
my college education.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
