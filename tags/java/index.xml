I have a friend in my neighborhood who teaches high school computer science. When she happened to mention that she was trying a new curriculum for one of her classes, I asked her which programming language she was planning to use in her class.</description></item><item><title>Review: Java Concurrency in Practice</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/03/17/review-java-concurrency-in-practice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 23:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/03/17/review-java-concurrency-in-practice/</guid><description>I was recently assigned to a new project at work, which requires some concurrent programming. I&amp;rsquo;ve long put off investing in any formal Java programming texts, partly out of thriftiness and partially because none of the professional programming I&amp;rsquo;ve done to date required a formal education/reading of relevant texts to avoid writing completely incorrect code. Usually in line-of-business application development, a sub-optimal solution is not completely incorrect; at worst, it wastes CPU cycles.</description></item><item><title>Why Kotlin Over Lombok?</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/12/23/why-kotlin-over-lombok/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 21:47:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/12/23/why-kotlin-over-lombok/</guid><description>This is a continuation of the ideas from &amp;ldquo;Is Kotlin the New Java?&amp;rdquo;.
What is Lombok? For those of you who are not familiar, Project Lombok is a build tool for the Java programming language, which adds nifty capabilities that many Java developers feel they sorely lack. Some of the more vanilla features include:
&amp;ldquo;Getter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Setter&amp;rdquo; generators &amp;ldquo;ToString&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;EqualsAndHashCode&amp;rdquo; generators &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Value&amp;rdquo; class generators Automatic resource cleanup Not-Null assertions Builder class generators Constructor helpers of various sorts There&amp;rsquo;s also a few more exotic features (which I personally have not seen developers) use in the wild, but which no doubt someone is using, including suppressing checked exceptions, lazy fields, magic &amp;ldquo;val&amp;rdquo; keyword, delegation, &amp;ldquo;with&amp;quot;ers, util and helper classes.</description></item><item><title>Is Kotlin the new Java?</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/06/28/is-kotlin-the-new-java/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2017 00:20:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/06/28/is-kotlin-the-new-java/</guid><description>One of the programming languages I&amp;rsquo;ve (essentially) been ignoring for the past couple of years has been Kotlin, the “better Java” from Jetbrains, the author of IntelliJ and other IDE&amp;rsquo;s.1 Recently, Kotlin has come back into focus for me for the following reasons:
Google finally announced official Android support for Kotlin Steve Yegge, that infamously opinionated programming language enthusiast, wrote a patently Yeggian post about how Kotlin scratches his itches without supporting academic or impractical features.</description></item></channel></rss>
