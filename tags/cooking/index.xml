&lt;p>Last year, I picked up an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Pot">Instant Pot&lt;/a> multi cooker, thinking it would simplify cooking dinner on weeknights. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve owned and used it for about 9 months, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share what I like about it, and what I don’t. For the record, I’m using the basic &lt;a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/">Instant Pot Duo 6-quart model&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="capabilities-i-use">Capabilities I Use&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Instant Pot is sort of like a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_oven">Dutch Oven&lt;/a> — it’s a thick-bottomed steel pot that can sauté, steam, and pressure cook food. And, much like a Dutch Oven, it’s very handy that quite a few recipes can be made in a single pot, which simplifies preparation and cleanup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making chicken stock from scratch</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/04/09/making-chicken-stock-from-scratch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:07:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/04/09/making-chicken-stock-from-scratch/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday, I woke up and decided to try and make chicken stock from scratch.
And, after another ten minutes of
reflection, I further resolved to make it &amp;ldquo;from scratch&amp;rdquo; if at all possible.
I rushed out the door to go grocery shopping, and grabbed the first set of ingredients:
soup greens. Then, while I was at the butcher, I grabbed the second set of ingredients:
chicken bones (prepackaged). (The bones ran me about $5, but my butcher charges a lot
because they&amp;rsquo;re the only game in town; I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure at other places it would
be cheaper.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Dini Delivers</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/03/17/review-dini-delivers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 20:10:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/03/17/review-dini-delivers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately, both my wife and I have been working long
hours at our jobs; the health of our diets have suffered as a result. Although
we have a few minutes each night to cook, we don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to run out to
the market in the middle of the week, or to lavish time on a full-course meal.
Whereas in years past I used to dictate the meal plan for the week and put two
or three complex dishes into each weeks&amp;rsquo; menu, that either my wife or I would
simply make after arriving home from work, these days we scarcely even have time
for that. We often just make pasta or chicken and call it a night.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Programming is Like Cooking</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2016/01/09/how-programming-is-like-cooking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2016/01/09/how-programming-is-like-cooking/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Nau">Peter Naur&lt;/a>,
famous in the programming world for his contributions to
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60">ALGOL&lt;/a>
and the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">Backus-Naur Form (BNF)&lt;/a>
notation for expressing grammars,
passed away last week. (For those who are not in the programming world,
ALGOL&amp;rsquo;s grammatical syntax inspired most of today&amp;rsquo;s most popular
programming languages, like C, C++, Java, and Python).
As a very young millennial programmer, I&amp;rsquo;d of course heard Naur&amp;rsquo;s name
from the BNF notation, but didn&amp;rsquo;t really get to appreciate just how prescient
his work was at the time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
