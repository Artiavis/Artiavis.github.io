And, after another ten minutes of reflection, I further resolved to make it &amp;ldquo;from scratch&amp;rdquo; if at all possible. I rushed out the door to go grocery shopping, and grabbed the first set of ingredients: soup greens. Then, while I was at the butcher, I grabbed the second set of ingredients: chicken bones (prepackaged). (The bones ran me about $5, but my butcher charges a lot because they're the only game in town; I'm pretty sure at other places it would be cheaper.</description></item><item><title>Review: Dini Delivers</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/03/17/review-dini-delivers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2018 20:10:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/03/17/review-dini-delivers/</guid><description>Lately, both my wife and I have been working long hours at our jobs; the health of our diets have suffered as a result.

(For those who are not in the programming world, ALGOL's grammatical syntax inspired most of today's most popular programming languages, like C, C++, Java, and Python). As a very young millennial programmer, I'd of course heard Naur's name from the BNF notation, but didn't really get to appreciate just how prescient his work was at the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
