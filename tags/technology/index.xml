came up. At the moment, he uses the &amp;ldquo;Time Machine&amp;rdquo; feature built into his aging
MacBook Pro to do backups of his hard drive. However, his Time Machine is backing
up to an already tired external USB hard drive, and he&amp;rsquo;s now at the point where
both his laptop and his USB hard drive are at risk of keeling over whenever.
What should he be doing in his situation?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I am not jumping on the newly debuted iPhone</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/09/17/why-i-am-not-jumping-on-the-newly-debuted-iphone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 21:46:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/09/17/why-i-am-not-jumping-on-the-newly-debuted-iphone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Call me a crotchety old (young) man if you will. In fact, I can scarcely recognize
myself from the days of yore. When I was in school, I was constantly tinkering
with my Android phones (the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_ThunderBolt">&amp;ldquo;HTC Thunderbolt&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Butterfly">&amp;ldquo;HTC Droid DNA&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, respectively).
&lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/63820/android-rom">I would flash all sorts of ROMs&lt;/a>,
trying to squeeze extra performance or battery
life out of apps. I was thrilled to be able to find all sorts of sketchy apps
which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost a dime out of pocket, but which would pop up all sorts of
little ads. Android phones were good phones for me in college, where I had an
abundance of time and shortages of cash.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
