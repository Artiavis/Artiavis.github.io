      <description>Call me a crotchety old (young) man if you will. In fact, I can scarcely recognize myself from the days of yore. When I was in school, I was constantly tinkering with my Android phones (the &amp;ldquo;HTC Thunderbolt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;HTC Droid DNA&amp;rdquo;, respectively). I would flash all sorts of ROMs, trying to squeeze extra performance or battery life out of apps. I was thrilled to be able to find all sorts of sketchy apps which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost a dime out of pocket, but which would pop up all sorts of little ads.</description>
