to the States, but I wanted to briefly share some of my thoughts from my recent
honeymoon in Italy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My wife and I had our long-overdue honeymoon early last month, in gorgeous
Italy: Venice, Rome, Florence, and Milan.
This was the realization of a dream for us; few countries in the world have the
culture, history, art, dining, and exquisite beauty which Italy has.
We wanted to really see all the sights and soak up as much as possible, so
we decided to tour the major cities aggressively. (Maybe in a future visit
we can have the luxury of relaxing in a quiet resort and watching the world
pass us by.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pathways Israel</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2014/01/17/pathways-israel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2014/01/17/pathways-israel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each winter at University, I find myself wondering what to do with my winter breaks about a week before finals. Usually I spend my breaks conducting research for various labs at Rutgers, or else getting a head-start on school for the Spring. So about this time last month, while wondering what I would do with my (hopefully) final winter break of undergraduate studies, I received an email which offered a fantastic opportunity â€” go to Israel for two weeks on a deeply discounted program!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
