video games for a few years now.
(For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">“freemium”&lt;/a> business
model, it&amp;rsquo;s the strategy of selling a good
or service which is free to access but costs money for premium
features. Freemium software, especially video games, are popular
because the barrier to entry is made as low as possible to hook
people.

&lt;a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)">A Beautiful Mind&lt;/a>
and I wanted to learn a little more about Game Theory.
(My professor confessed that despite a large number of students taking the
class because of the movie, the little Game Theory used in the film is actually
incorrect. Oh well.) I find Game Theory fascinating and it really is a subject
that people should study, if only because its hyper-rational approach to life
actually has some applications, in addition to being insightful and stimulating.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
