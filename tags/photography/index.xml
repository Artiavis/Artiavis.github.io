&lt;p>A little bit over two years ago, I got back into photography with
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/">my purchase of the Fujifilm X100T&lt;/a>.
(You can see many of my exploits with it over in &lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/photos">my photo gallery&lt;/a>;
most of the older photos were taken with it.)
What I loved about that camera &amp;ndash; and still enjoy about it, really &amp;ndash; is how
&amp;ldquo;connected&amp;rdquo; I feel to photography using it. It has no extraneous bells or
whistles, and puts the photographer in charge of the photographic trinity
(aperture, shutter speed, ISO). It feels like an extension of the photographer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Speedlights with Nikon SB-900</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/08/25/learning-speedlights-with-nikon-sb-900/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Aug 2018 21:51:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/08/25/learning-speedlights-with-nikon-sb-900/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/08/21/the-switch-nikon-d700/">A few days ago I wrote about my experience shooting with the Nikon D700&lt;/a>.
At the time, I mentioned that I had borrowed the Nikon SB-900 speedlight (now discontinued)
with which to learn the beginnings of flash photography; not wanting to go on a
complete tangent about my learnings about flash photography, I didn&amp;rsquo;t dwell on it then.
Today, though, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of my earliest learnings using the SB-900.
I used the book
&amp;ldquo;
&lt;a href="https://amazon.com/dp/0817439560">Understanding Flash Photography&lt;/a>
&amp;rdquo; by Bryan Peterson
as a learning reference. (I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s necessarily the best book for this purpose,
but it served well enough as a learning reference. If I was looking to get into professional
portraiture or event photography, I&amp;rsquo;d no doubt get a book on that specifically.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Switch â€“ Nikon D700</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/08/21/the-switch-nikon-d700/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:17:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/08/21/the-switch-nikon-d700/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the beginning of July,
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/07/04/one-year-with-fujifilm-x100t/">I commemorated one year with the Fujifilm X100T&lt;/a>.
Although it
is more targeted &lt;em>and&lt;/em> limited than an interchangeable-lens (ILC) camera.
I really believe this limitation is a huge boon for learning.
The rangefinder-styled camera, with a fast fixed-perspective lens, moves without
my conscious intervention to capture a fleeting vision, the same way that a spoonful
of soup just rises from my bowl and up to my mouth without really registering in my mind.
When I think back to my high school photography, tinkering with my
father&amp;rsquo;s DSLR, that whole affair seems rather crude by comparison.
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/Elegant_Weapon_for_a_More_Civilized_Age">A more elegant weapon, for a more civilized age&lt;/a>,&amp;rdquo;
is an apt comparison between the nimble, even diminutive
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera">rangefinder&lt;/a> over the overwrought,
glass-clad hand-cannon we call the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera">SLR&lt;/a>.
Only once I freed myself of the concerns of lenses and zooms, and sat down to

&lt;a href="https://amazon.com/dp/1607748509">learn exposure in earnest&lt;/a>
, could I come back
to face the terrible SLR. So when my father offered to lend me his main SLR gear bag
for a few weeks, I accepted with trepidation, and lent him my X100 in turn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One year with Fujifilm X100T</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/07/04/one-year-with-fujifilm-x100t/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2018 12:11:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/07/04/one-year-with-fujifilm-x100t/</guid><description>&lt;p>One year ago today, I resumed my long-adjourned photography hobby,
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/">with the Fujifilm X100T&lt;/a>.
There&amp;rsquo;s two thoughts I&amp;rsquo;d like to share today.
You can see some of my photos at &lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/photos">my photo gallery&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fujifilm-x100t--a-retrospective">Fujifilm X100T &amp;ndash; a retrospective&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I still think that the Fuji X100T was one of the best possible cameras I could
have picked up at the time. Its great manual controls and compact size made it
a great camera for learning and taking everywhere. Its classic styling and
compact size makes it a secret weapon in the hands of someone moderately
experienced, as it can go toe-to-toe with a crop-sized DSLR in its areas of
strength, all while not intimidating to friends and family.
And its integration with the
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/11/29/fujifilm-instax-sp-2-the-friendly-portable-photograph-printer/">Instax SP2 smartphone printer&lt;/a>
are great, both for starting conversations, and for handing out keepsakes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fuji LH X100 lens hood</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/05/22/fuji-lh-x100-lens-hood/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2018 21:59:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2018/05/22/fuji-lh-x100-lens-hood/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the continuation of my slow but inexorable backslide into the Fuji camera gear
universe, I recently picked up a secondhand lens hood for my
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/">X100T&lt;/a>. Although it was a bit on the
expensive side, I figured the construction would be of higher quality and more
natural looking (in keeping with the traditional charm of the camera itself).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/img/2018/05/22/LH-X100T.jpg">
&lt;/figure>

&lt;h2 id="construction-and-fit">Construction and fit&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The lens hood system comprises two pieces, and adapter which threads onto the
front of the base lens; and the hood itself, which cleverly twists and locks onto
flanges on the edge of the adapter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Asking About Camera Advice</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/12/17/asking-about-camera-advice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 22:03:02 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/12/17/asking-about-camera-advice/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting questions from a few family members and colleagues about
which cameras (or kinds of cameras) they should consider getting. Generally, I
get this question from folks with relatively recent smartphones (e.g. iPhone 6S+)
who believe that they may be able to take better photographs with a better,
standalone camera. (I mostly get this question from parents of young kids, but
I&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten it once or twice from people interested in vacation photos or
lifestyle photography.) I&amp;rsquo;ll reference some useful guides by &lt;a href="http://dpreview.com">http://dpreview.com&lt;/a>
(disclaimer, they are owned by my employer) and add notes where I think they&amp;rsquo;re
useful. I hope that these links prove useful to those who are looking for this guidance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fuji TCL-X100 II</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/12/05/fuji-tcl-x100-ii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 21:45:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/12/05/fuji-tcl-x100-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>In addition to
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/11/29/fujifilm-instax-sp-2-the-friendly-portable-photograph-printer/">my aforementioned impulsive purchase of the Fujifilm Instax SP-2 smartphone printer&lt;/a>
(for printing mementos from social occasions), I also impulsively purchased the
&lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1311235-REG/fujifilm_16534730_tcl_x100_ii_tele_conversion.html">Fujifilm TCL-X100 II&lt;/a>
teleconversion lens for my
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/">Fujifilm X100T&lt;/a> camera.
This was something I was thinking about for &lt;del>a while&lt;/del> about a week, and
although I hesitated quite a bit in the store, I ended up pulling the trigger on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/img/2017/12/05/side-shot-fuji-tcl-x100.jpg"
 alt="Fuji TCL-X100 II lens">&lt;figcaption>
 &lt;p>The Fuji TCL-X100 II conveter lens is an engineering marvel, and when attached to the camera, looks quite convincingly part of the original body. It&amp;rsquo;s quite attractive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fujifilm Instax SP-2: The Friendly Portable Photograph Printer</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/11/29/fujifilm-instax-sp-2-the-friendly-portable-photograph-printer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/11/29/fujifilm-instax-sp-2-the-friendly-portable-photograph-printer/</guid><description>&lt;p>A little over a week ago, I went out and picked up the 
&lt;a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B01GTKG6RA">Fujifilm Instax SP-2&lt;/a>
 (smartphone) printer from &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a> to bring to a friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding.
Though this was a bit of an impulse purchase, I had my eye on this printer for a couple of weeks, and thought I would get good use out of it going into Thanksgiving Weekend. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like a Polaroid for the 21st century, except you know (more or less) what your pics will turn out like before printing. (This is essentially a more expensive, stand-alone version of Fujifilm&amp;rsquo;s Instax line of cameras, which use the same types of film for a true Polaroid experience.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mpix Photo Prints</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/09/14/mpix-photo-prints/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 00:40:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/09/14/mpix-photo-prints/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/">As I recently discussed&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently
acquired a camera for improving my family photography (and maybe also indulging
in some hobbyist photography as well). My original motivation for purchasing that
camera was not just to have better quality digital photos, but especially to have
beautiful photos which I can frame or put into family albums.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve been shooting for a little while, I decided to order some prints
online. Although my father (and significant photography influencer) uses AdoramaPix,
I heard good things about &lt;a href="https://mpix.com/">Mpix&lt;/a> and decided to give them a go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fuji X100T</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2017 21:43:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t/</guid><description>&lt;p>On July 4th, I jetted over to &lt;a href="//www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a> to pick up a new(ly used) camera.
I walked out with a
&lt;a href="//www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x100t/">Fujifilm X100T&lt;/a>
mirrorless point-and-shoot camera. This is the
story of how I chose that camera, and how I feel about it a few weeks later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/img/2017/08/13/fuji-x100t-official-img.jpg" alt="Official FujiFilm website image for X100T">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-all-begins">It all begins&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>with me staying up until 4 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning one Saturday night. What had
begun as an innocent review of my family photos perversely devolved into a
compulsive episode of researching cameras with which to upgrade said family
photos. Those family photos were recorded almost exclusively with the iPhone 5s
and iPhone 6; yet, once printed, the quality left quite a bit to be desired.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using ACDsee for Photography</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/07/11/using-acdsee-for-photography/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:42:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2017/07/11/using-acdsee-for-photography/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in a more powerful digital photography
workflow solution than the brutish practice of shuffling JPG files around on my
hard drive and hoping for the best. I have really been seeking one (or more)
specialized programs which can handle the common photography tasks of organizing
photos from the moment they leave the camera to their final resting place on my
hard drive (and/or backup server), and performing common photo editing upon them
like curve adjustments and blemish removal. These solutions also needed to work
natively on Windows, integrate well with NAS solutions, and be capable enough
with RAW files. I was willing to pay for the software, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have
to spend more than $75, and certainly not over $100, considering I am at best an
amateur photographer. I&amp;rsquo;m also mindful of my privacy&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
After spending several hours researching the options available
to me, I have decided to use &lt;a href="https://www.acdsee.com/en/products/acdsee-pro">ACDSee Pro 10&lt;/a> as my one-stop shop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm Impressed by iPhone Photography</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2016/06/26/im-impressed-by-iphone-photography/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2016/06/26/im-impressed-by-iphone-photography/</guid><description>&lt;p>My wife and I got back from our honeymoon in Italy a few weeks ago
(&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2016/06/26/my-first-holiday-in-italy/">which you can read about here&lt;/a>),
and I need to remark on how impressed I am by the performance our iPhones.
Both my wife&amp;rsquo;s iPhone 5S and my iPhone 6 performed spectacularly, taking
hundreds of photos for us during our ten days on holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of marketing hype about how good the iPhone camera is,
but this was my first time relying exclusively upon a smartphone camera for
pictures of a momentous chapter of my life, and I now buy the hype. The
iPhone really punches above its weight class in terms of performance and cost
efficiency. Because we were using smartphones, we were also able to rely
on Google Photos seamlessly backing up
full quality copies of our photos every night, to ensure we didn&amp;rsquo;t lose any
photos while we were trekking around.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bitmap Graphics vs Vector Graphics</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/11/21/bitmap-graphics-vs-vector-graphics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/11/21/bitmap-graphics-vs-vector-graphics/</guid><description>&lt;p>One astute reader of
&lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/11/04/how-to-smooth-out-the-curves-understanding-digital-image-filtering/">a previous post&lt;/a> observed that
although I seemed to imply that only
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap">bitmaps&lt;/a>
can be digital images, there also exists such a thing as
&lt;a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">vector graphics&lt;/a>
which are also considered
digital images. At the time, it was not clear in context what was meant in
describing an image as &lt;em>digital&lt;/em>. While I conflated digital images with bitmaps,
which is inaccurate, I was only discussing bitmaps in that post, and the
conclusions therein are still valid.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Smooth Out the Curves - Understanding Digital Image Filtering</title><link>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/11/04/how-to-smooth-out-the-curves-understanding-digital-image-filtering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/11/04/how-to-smooth-out-the-curves-understanding-digital-image-filtering/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.justabloginthepark.com/2013/10/30/how-to-pump-up-the-bass-understanding-audio-frequencies/">a previous post&lt;/a>, I discussed the physical
interpretation of digital music (and all digital audio) as both a time-varying
signal and a frequency-varying signal. This, of course, makes intuitive sense -
as we spend three or four minutes listening to a song, we can hear the guitars
and horns coming in and fading out, a singer intone the chorus of a song, etc.
At the same time, we appreciate the frequencies changing as well â€” the
singer hitting different notes, the instruments forming different chords.
Understanding the time and frequency behavior of auditory information is fairly
intuitive - in fact, one could even argue that visualizing the frequency-based
content is more informative than visualizing the time-based content.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
