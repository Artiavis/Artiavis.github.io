Generally, I get this question from folks with relatively recent smartphones (e.g. iPhone 6S+) who believe that they may be able to take better photographs with a better, standalone camera. (I mostly get this question from parents of young kids, but I&rsquo;ve also gotten it once or twice from people interested in vacation photos or lifestyle photography.) I&rsquo;ll reference some useful guides by http://dpreview.com (disclaimer, they are owned by my employer) and add notes where I think they&rsquo;re useful. I hope that these links prove useful to those who are looking for this guidance.

This was something I was thinking about for a while about a week, and although I hesitated quite a bit in the store, I ended up pulling the trigger on it.
The Fuji TCL-X100 II conveter lens is an engineering marvel, and when attached to the camera, looks quite convincingly part of the original body. It&rsquo;s quite attractive.

Though this was a bit of an impulse purchase, I had my eye on this printer for a couple of weeks, and thought I would get good use out of it going into Thanksgiving Weekend. It&rsquo;s kind of like a Polaroid for the 21st century, except you know (more or less) what your pics will turn out like before printing. (This is essentially a more expensive, stand-alone version of Fujifilm&rsquo;s Instax line of cameras, which use the same types of film for a true Polaroid experience.)

My original motivation for purchasing that camera was not just to have better quality digital photos, but especially to have beautiful photos which I can frame or put into family albums.
Now that I&rsquo;ve been shooting for a little while, I decided to order some prints online. Although my father (and significant photography influencer) uses AdoramaPix, I heard good things about Mpix and decided to give them a go.

I walked out with a Fujifilm X100T mirrorless point-and-shoot camera. This is the story of how I chose that camera, and how I feel about it a few weeks later.
It all begins&mldr; with me staying up until 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning one Saturday night. What had begun as an innocent review of my family photos perversely devolved into a compulsive episode of researching cameras with which to upgrade said family photos. Those family photos were recorded almost exclusively with the iPhone 5s and iPhone 6; yet, once printed, the quality left quite a bit to be desired.
