as my default text editor for most things, having switched from
&lt;a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text&lt;/a>. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m using
the brilliant &lt;a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs">Spacemacs&lt;/a>
project, which can best be described as a fairly comprehensive set of
sensible defaults and plugins for Emacs with a clever plugin architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to be a casual &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">VIM&lt;/a>
user for remote file editing and a Sublime Text
user for local editing (with plugins). However, neither of these solutions
truly satisfied me. VIM is tricky to get fully working plugins for,
and a new set of plugins is needed for every target host. Keeping the
VIM plugins in sync is a chore even if effort is dedicated to it.
Sublime is also very nice, and has a better plugins story, but some of
the capabilities don&amp;rsquo;t seem to go far enough in my opinion. After hearing
many good things about Emacs using Spacemacs, I decided to check it out.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
