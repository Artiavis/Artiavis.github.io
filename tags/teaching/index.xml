I can&amp;rsquo;t due justice to the article, so I won&amp;rsquo;t even try to summarize it. (Definitely read it before reading on here.)
However, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth sharing because it highlights one of the most fundamental things that we take for granted when trying to teach friends or family something (not all of us are trained teachers). Not every new concept is actually so complex and layered that it can&amp;rsquo;t be easily intuited by someone with basic knowledge.</description></item></channel></rss>
