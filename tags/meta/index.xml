      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long while since I last blogged. My last post dates back to April of 2014, shortly before I graduated from Rutgers Engineering. My life since then has been a bit of a whirlwind. I&amp;rsquo;ve since graduated, moved to the Upper West Side, started working in banking, gotten engaged and married, and moved out. I suppose I could be forgiven for not blogging as actively.
Why I Took Down My Old Blog My old blog was running on Ghost, a nifty JavaScript-based modern reimagination of the classic web-based blogging platform.</description>

      <description>I love going for walks in the park. Whether I&amp;rsquo;m flushed with ideas and want to let them percolate in my head, or I&amp;rsquo;m bone dry and can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get a single thought to hit me, I find going for a walk always helps. Something about keeping moving and watching the world stroll by always seems to get the juices flowing at just the right pace.
But a walk can&amp;rsquo;t be just anywhere to have this effect.</description>
