&lt;em>&lt;strong>Caveat&lt;/strong>: I hold these opinions and make these recommendations specifically
with respect to high school students (or casual hobbyists).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a friend in my neighborhood who teaches high school computer science.
When she happened to mention that she was trying a new curriculum for one of
her classes, I asked her which programming language she was planning to use
in her class. She said that she hadn&amp;rsquo;t quite decided yet, but was leaning
towards JavaScript, because it&amp;rsquo;s ubiquitous and (importantly!) runs well on her
school&amp;rsquo;s Chromebook machines.
Upon hearing that she was favoring JavaScript,
I ran my mouth and
recommend that she instead consider Python.
Based on my professional experience with both JavaScript and Python,
I feel comfortable stating that JavaScript has quite a few pitfalls in terms of
learning, and has a non-trivial path to writing high-quality code.
I also feel comfortable stating that Python has a number of educational virtues,
and has a fairly strong path for students to learn to write high-quality code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
