My frenetic journey culminated in purchasing the <a href=https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid-type-s>Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional Hybrid Type-S</a>, the fanciest model in the Happy Hacking Keyboard (&ldquo;HHKB&rdquo;) family of keyboards. I though I&rsquo;d share my thoughts and impressions with you, in case you&rsquo;re curious and want to learn more.</p><figure><img src=/img/2022/XT301126.jpeg alt="Photograph of the Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional Hybrid Type-S"></figure><h2 id=my-rating-of-the-hhkb>My Rating of the HHKB</h2><p><em>You can click on the categories in the table below to jump to the relevant section in this post.</em></p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Category</th><th style=text-align:right>Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left><a href=#typing-experience>Typing</a></td><td style=text-align:right>5/5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><a href=#gaming-experience>Gaming</a></td><td style=text-align:right>3/5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><a href=#build-quality>Build Quality</a></td><td style=text-align:right>4/5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><a href=#connectivity>Connectivity</a></td><td style=text-align:right>5/5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><a href=#battery-life>Battery Life</a></td><td style=text-align:right>5/5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><a href=#value>Value</a></td><td style=text-align:right>2/5</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=typing-experience>Typing Experience</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve tried a few keyboards in my life, and found something maddening about them; cheap rubber-dome keyboards feel like play-dough; scissor-switch keyboards make my fingertips ache; and mechanical keyboards are loud and heavy. I have used mechanical keyboards for the past 7 years or so (MX Cherry Browns), and although I like them for gaming and typing, they were never really my end-all-be-all keyboard.</p><p>Now, after using this keyboard for a week, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine going back; The unique topre key switches with the factory-installed silencing rings and lubrication provide a satisfying tactility, a sturdy spring to the keypress, and sound like rain falling gently on a tin roof. As weird as it sounds, I can imagine myself falling asleep to the sound of someone typing on this keyboard. My fingers never get tired of typing on this keyboard, and I get a small thrill typing on it.</p><p>Another unique aspect of this keyboard, beside the topre switches, is the set of layout changes that subtly but radically improve the typing experience: moving the Control and Delete keys closer to the home row, and eliminating keys far away from the home row. In this way, I can use keyboard shortcuts without overtaxing my fingers, and fixing small errors doesn&rsquo;t break my flow. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how much of a difference this makes, but in hindsight, it&rsquo;s such a no-brainer that I&rsquo;ve reprogrammed all my other computers to match this layout as much as possible.</p><h3 id=gaming-experience>Gaming Experience</h3><p>I&rsquo;m giving this keyboard a 3/5 for gaming because the topre keys are fine for gaming genres such as RPG&rsquo;s or casual strategy/shooter/action games, but liable to get in the way for rapid-fire games like FPS or professional RTS. Some may especially dislike the lack of dedicated function or arrow keys, although your mileage may vary.</p><p><em>Nerdy explanation below.</em></p><p>The topre key mechanism (you can see some good illustrations <a href=https://keyboardsexpert.com/topre-switches-complete-guide-keyboards-101/>here</a>) consists of both a mechanical component and a rubber-dome component, and thus gets one big advantage of a mechanical keyboard, and one big drawback of a rubber-dome keyboard.</p><p>Like a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mechanical keyboard, the topre switch has a an electromechanical component that registers a key press <em>in the middle of actuation</em>. This predictable actuation force improves finger-mind coordination, because it&rsquo;s easier to intuit <em>when</em> a certain action may take place during a game when pressing the key down. Anyone who&rsquo;s gamed for any length of time knows that this is one of the indispensable elements of a good gaming keyboard.</p><p>However, the topre switch is missing the <em>other</em> element of a good gaming keyboard &ndash; predictable and repeatable &ldquo;twitch&rdquo; capability. A &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mechanical key-switch is spring-loaded. An experienced gamer can learn exactly how much force is required to keep the springs at a specific height, and to repeatedly activate the same key (&ldquo;twitching&rdquo;). In split-second gaming scenarios, this capability is crucial. Unfortunately for twitch-gamers, the topre upstroke is not spring-loaded, but instead occurs due to compression and rebound of rubber cups. This rubbery response is <em>very</em> hard to reliably twitch.</p><p>Overall, the topres are at least as good as rubber-domes for gaming. They&rsquo;re just not as good as the best &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mechanical keys. And that&rsquo;s okay, as long as you know that going in. (Note: Presumably, if you&rsquo;re twitch-gaming, you&rsquo;re also using a USB connection to minimize latency.)</p><h3 id=build-quality>Build Quality</h3><p>The HHKB build quality is simple but understated. The keyboard is constructed out of a lightweight plastic, but well-assembled; it feels solid enough to carry around in a bag, and light enough to be an every-day carry for a motivated enthusiast. I suspect that a large part of the unique sound-signature of the HHKB is due to the types of plastic and assembly used in its construction.</p><p>The plastic of the keys gently grip the fingers in a way that&rsquo;s hard to describe, and which I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever noticed on a keyboard before. I can&rsquo;t put a price on what that&rsquo;s worth to me, but I notice and appreciate it when I&rsquo;m resting my fingers on the home row.</p><p>The only reason why I&rsquo;m rating Build Quality as a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is that I can only give a 5/5 to an indestructible tank of a keyboard, and that&rsquo;s not the HHKB. And, to be clear, <em>that&rsquo;s just how I want it.</em> If I had a keyboard that I had rated as a 5/5, I would never take it anywhere, because it would be <em>way too heavy</em>.</p><h3 id=connectivity>Connectivity</h3><p>This is a Bluetooth keyboard. As anyone who&rsquo;s used Bluetooth can attest, Bluetooth devices vary greatly in the quality and reliability of their implementations. How good is the Bluetooth on the HHKB?</p><p>I&rsquo;d have to say, excellent. This keyboard can memorize up to 4 Bluetooth devices at a time, and switching between devices is nearly instant (I&rsquo;ve never seen it take more than 1 second to switch). Because I bounce between my work computer and home computer a lot, I really appreciate the multi-device support.</p><p>Something else that&rsquo;s really reassuring is that the keyboard has a hard-wired USB-C pass-through mode, which allows the keyboard to work even without batteries (or if there&rsquo;s a lot of radio interference). This turns out to be <em>especially useful with Apple hardware</em>, because <em>Apple doesn&rsquo;t allow non-Apple Bluetooth keyboards to connect to my Mac mini after a restart</em>.</p><h3 id=battery-life>Battery Life</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re buying a Bluetooth keyboard, you need it to have respectable battery life. That&rsquo;s not <em>usually</em> a problem, because Bluetooth doesn&rsquo;t consume a lot of power, and neither does registering keystrokes. However, some keyboards like to add frills like RGB lighting or backlights, which significantly cut into battery life and longevity. THat&rsquo;s not a factor with this no-frills keyboard &ndash; the only light is a status LED for boot/switching devices/low power alerts.</p><p>This keyboard is rated for 3 months of battery life from a pair of fresh AA batteries; at the rate I&rsquo;m going, I may be able to get 6 months or more out of a single charge. For me, that&rsquo;s more than plenty; I&rsquo;m happy as long as I&rsquo;m not swapping the batteries out more than once a month.</p><h3 id=value>Value</h3><p>This keyboard was not cheap; I paid around $330 for the high-end model. When evaluating value, I ask myself, &ldquo;Could I get the same or similar for less money?&rdquo; In answering this question, I landed on a value rating of 2/5.</p><p>I could buy a great all-around scissor-switch Bluetooth keyboard like the <a href=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2A3LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english>Apple Magic Keyboard</a> or the <a href=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mini-for-mac.920-010389.html>Logitech MX Keys Mini</a> for $100. Or, looking at mechanical options, I could instead pick up a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39900391309401">Keychron K2</a> for $70, or the new <a href=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.920-010550.html>Logitech MX Mechnical Mini</a> for $150.</p><p>Now, where does that leave the HHKB, at over 3 times the price of the scissor-switch Logitech, over 2 times the price of the mechnical Logitech, and nearly 5 times the price of the Keychron? It simply cannot match those other keyboards in terms of bang-for-the-buck.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s fine. I went in eyes-wide-open, expecting a sublime typing experience, and getting all I could have asked for, and more. To me, that made it worth splurging on, value aside.</p><h2 id=who-is-this-for>Who is this For?</h2><p>This keyboard is for typing enthusiasts who can afford to make a enthusiast purchase.</p><h2 id=what-is-unique-about-this-product>What is unique about this product?</h2><p>This keyboard is unique due to its unique Topre key switches, and its clever non-standard layout that improves day-to-day typing experience.</p><h2 id=would-i-buy-it-again>Would I buy it again?</h2><p>I enjoy my purchase, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d regret buying another similar keyboard in the $200 range, either.</p><h2 id=facts>Facts</h2><p><em>These were copied out of the user manual for the product; you may find them helpful for the discussion below.</em></p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Category</th><th style=text-align:left>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Number of Keys/Form Factor</td><td style=text-align:left>60-key / 60%</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Key Switch Mechanism</td><td style=text-align:left>Topre</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Weight (grams)</td><td style=text-align:left>540g (not including batteries)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Weight (oz)</td><td style=text-align:left>19 oz (not including batteries)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Dimensions (mm)</td><td style=text-align:left>294x120x40mm</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Dimensions (inches)</td><td style=text-align:left>11.6" x 4.7" x 1.6"</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Bluetooth Version</td><td style=text-align:left>4.2</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Bluetooth Devices</td><td style=text-align:left>4 at a time (not including a hard-wired connection over USB-C)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Battery Type</td><td style=text-align:left>User-replaceable AA Batteries</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Battery Life</td><td style=text-align:left>3 Months</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><aside><div id=disqus_thread></div></aside><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript rel=nofollow>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type=text/javascript>var disqus_shortname="justabloginthepark",disqus_loaded=!1;function disqus(){if(!disqus_loaded){if(disqus_loaded=!0,window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src="//"+disqus_shortname+".disqus.com/embed.js",(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(e)}}</script><script type=text/javascript>window.onscroll=function(){window.innerHeight+window.scrollY>=document.body.offsetHeight&&(disqus_loaded||disqus())}</script></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; <a href=https://github.com/Artiavis>Jeff Rabinowitz</a>, 2022</p></div></section><script type=text/javascript src=/js/bulmamenu.min.js defer></script>
