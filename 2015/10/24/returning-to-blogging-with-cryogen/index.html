My last post dates back to
April of 2014, shortly before I graduated from Rutgers Engineering.
My life since then has been a bit of a whirlwind. I&rsquo;ve since graduated,
moved to the Upper West Side, started working in banking, gotten engaged
and married, and moved out. I suppose I could be forgiven for not blogging
as actively.</p><h2 id=why-i-took-down-my-old-blog>Why I Took Down My Old Blog</h2><p>My old blog was running on <a href=ghost.org>Ghost</a>, a nifty JavaScript-based
modern reimagination of the classic web-based blogging platform. Ghost
has some gorgeous themes, a svelte editing experience, and seems poised
to be the next generation of blogging platforms. It seems great. Why
did I leave it behind?</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t really a free option for hosting Ghost
(at least, that I was aware of). Ghost needs to be hosted on a web
server somewhere. Although this can cost as little as $5 a month to
leave online, I knew that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to blog for a long
while and didn&rsquo;t want to bother paying for it while it wasn&rsquo;t in use.
I made the decision to export my data (which Ghost does make fairly
easy) and wait until things might settle down and I would have time
to revisit blogging.</p><h2 id=why-static-site-generation>Why Static Site Generation</h2><p>Since I took down my Ghost blog, I&rsquo;d learned a bit more about the blogging
ecosystem. It turns out that, in addition to costing money to host a
blog against a dynamic database, there are also security implications
to hosting a blog on a server. If a “live” blog is running
on a server, it needs to be running live code while connected to both
a database and an untrusted network (the internet). While a server
running only a blog is probably not at significant risk of compromising
personal information, it&rsquo;s still an unpleasant responsibility to need
to constantly update a server to patch security holes. This is doubly
the case when blogging really doesn&rsquo;t need anything beyond the ability
to publish text files – blogs can be published using so-called
flat files, for free, and with no security ramifications.</p><p>Instead, I&rsquo;m moving my blog&rsquo;s hosting to <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a>,
which hosts statically generated blogs as long as they conform to certain
(relatively easy to meet) criteria.</p><h2 id=which-static-site-generator>Which Static Site Generator?</h2><p>I already knew I wanted to use static site generation to blog, but I hadn&rsquo;t
yet decided which software to use. A major consideration for me was that it
had to be in a language which I can program in, in case I wanted to hack on the
software or add features. Fortunately, <a href=https://www.staticgen.com/>Static Gen</a>
is a site which tracks the repositories for all static site generators on GitHub
across all languages. It proved to help me considerably in making my choice.</p><p>Although I feel competent in Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and even Clojure,
I knew I could only consider using a generator which was based in either
Python or Clojure.</p><ul><li><p>Java is obviously to verbose and enterprisey for a simple blog generator</p></li><li><p>Although I&rsquo;ve programmed in Ruby before, and I do think it&rsquo;s a beautiful language,
I&rsquo;ve struggled enough with managing Python environments to know that I don&rsquo;t want
to tangle with managing Ruby environments too, if even for something as simple
as a blog. This makes things tricky, as three of the top static site generators
(Jekyll, Octopress, and Middleman) are in Ruby.</p></li><li><p>JavaScript is a messy language with a messy ecosystem: ‘nuff said.
Although it has perhaps the greatest profusion of libraries since Java itself,
the libraries are constantly moving, and the wheel seems to constantly be reinvented.
I&rsquo;d also rather avoid tangling with JavaScript if at all possible.
(Why did I leave Ghost, a JavaScript blogging platform, to just go back to
JavaScript static site generation?)</p></li></ul><h3 id=taking-a-stab-at-pelican>Taking a Stab at Pelican</h3><p>Since my strongest language is currently Python, and I have a wealth of experience
with the unpleasantness of managing Python environments gained from work, I decided
to try out a Python static site generator first.
A cursory Google search indicated that <a href=https://github.com/getpelican/pelican>Pelican</a>
seems like one of the best Python generators currently available. I <code>pip install</code>ed
a bunch of dependencies and spent several hours trying in vain to hook up the system
with a palatable theme and plugins to incorporate reasonable things like Disqus integration.</p><p>Although Pelican seems well designed (the signals for lifecycle events seems especially
clever), I just couldn&rsquo;t hack it together. The default theme is not particularly attractive.
I tried the eponymous and seemingly fully-featured
<a href=http://oncrashreboot.com/elegant-best-pelican-theme-features>Elegant Pelican</a>
theme, but couldn&rsquo;t get the site to build properly. In anger I moved on to Clojure.</p><h3 id=cryogen---a-relatively-simple-clojure-static-site-generator>Cryogen - a Relatively Simple Clojure Static Site Generator</h3><p>The first Clojure site generator in the list was <a href=http://cryogenweb.org/>Cryogen</a>,
which appears to be a relatively simple and straightforward site generator.
Although it doesn&rsquo;t have many frills, I like how it&rsquo;s easier to get up and running.
Leiningen generally doesn&rsquo;t present any problems with setting up new applications
with their dependencies, unlike Python/Ruby/JavaScript. And unlike Pelican,
it comes with a clean and pleasant Bootstrap theme out of the box.
The deal was sealed for me when I saw that
<a href=http://yogthos.net/posts/2014-11-13-Cryogen-static-site-generation-made-easy.html>the famous Yogthos</a>
is a primary user of it.</p><h2 id=looking-forward>Looking Forward</h2><p>So far, I like Cryogen. Although it takes a couple of seconds to cross-reference my
tags across the site, it&rsquo;s nice that it ships with a fully baked web server,
and has a lean core. Here&rsquo;s hoping it bears me steady through several years of blogging.</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><aside><div id=disqus_thread></div></aside><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript rel=nofollow>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><script type=text/javascript>var disqus_shortname='justabloginthepark',disqus_loaded=!1;function disqus(){if(!disqus_loaded){if(disqus_loaded=!0,window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var a=document.createElement('script');a.type='text/javascript',a.async=!0,a.src='//'+disqus_shortname+'.disqus.com/embed.js',(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(a)}}</script><script type=text/javascript>window.onscroll=function(a){window.innerHeight+window.scrollY>=document.body.offsetHeight&&(disqus_loaded||disqus())}</script></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; <a href=https://github.com/Artiavis>Jeff Rabinowitz</a>, 2021</p></div></section><script type=text/javascript src=/js/bulmamenu.min.js defer></script>
